# Wunderland-City-May-2022-No-Assets

# *******************************************************************************
# ESSENTIAL NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS - FOLLOW TO GET A WORKING GAME AFTER REPO PULL!
# *******************************************************************************

# This repository was created (from the point of the released game) to include missing meta files, and also had
# a couple of directory changes to reflect the inclusion of "External Assets" which CAN BE
# included in Source control, and to OMIT those "External Assets" which CANNOT be included due 
# to licencing agreements on the Unity Asset Store.

# The list FOUND BELOW contains details of ALL the REQUIRED ASSETS ("Free Assets") WHICH MUST BE (when pulling
# the repo) DOWNLOADED from the Unity Asset store, and IMPORTED into the Project individually!

# If you DON'T do this, the project will NOT RUN, and will be effectively BROKEN with lots of missing game objects / terrain data etc
# in all of the game scenes!
