# ESSENTIAL NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS
# ------------------------------
#
#
# There is an issue with missing terrain materials in the starting forest/mountain "Wolf Hills" scene which is to be sorted out in the future as this is NOT
# currently being developed any further now. I believe this is down to either importer problems OR a missing/incorrect meta file. TBD!
#
# This repository was re-created to include some missing meta files, and also had
# a couple of directory changes to reflect inclusion of External Assets which CAN be
# included in Source control, and those assets which CANNOT due to licence agreements on the
# Unity Asset Store.
#
# Therefore there will be a list which will be FOUND BELOW of REQUIRED ASSETS (Free Assets) which MUST be (when pulling
# a copy of the repo) DOWNLOADED from the Unity Asset store, and Imported into the Project individually.
#
# Without doing this, the project will NOT RUN, and will be effectively broken with lots of missing game objects
# in all of the scenes!
#
#
# SO PLEASE READ THE ASSET LIST, DOWNLOAD/IMPORT THEM, and OBEY! :o)
