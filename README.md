# ESSENTIAL NOTES FOR DEVELOPERS
# ------------------------------
#
# Please Note: When pulling this repo that:
#
# There is still an issue with some missing terrain materials in the starting forest/mountain "Wolf Hills" scene, and also the Mushroom City scene,
# this is to be sorted out in the future as this game is NOT currently being developed/maintained any further at present. 
# I believe this is down to either importer problems OR possibly some missing/incorrect meta files. TBD! Sorry!
#                                     ---------------------------------------------------
#
# This repository was re-created to include some missing meta files, and also had
# a couple of directory changes to reflect inclusion of External Assets which CAN be
# included in Source control, and those assets which CANNOT due to licence agreements on the
# Unity Asset Store.
#
# (Please note: Any assets which need to be pulled from the Unity Store, will need to be "moved" to the Assets/external assets folder, BUT ONLY
# from inside the Unity editor to avoid asset GUID's breaking!
# This will also be the case if updating when a new version of the asset becomes available due to asset creators in some cases hard-coding directory
# locations into them!)
#
# Therefore there will be a list which will be FOUND BELOW of REQUIRED ASSETS (Free Assets) which MUST be (when pulling
# a copy of the repo) DOWNLOADED from the Unity Asset store, and Imported into the Project individually.
#
# Without doing this, the project will NOT RUN, and will be effectively broken with lots of missing game objects
# in all of the scenes!
#
#
# SO PLEASE READ THE ASSET LIST, DOWNLOAD/IMPORT THEM, and OBEY! :o)
